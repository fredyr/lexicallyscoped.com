title: Compiling MiniML to Javascript

---

## What is MiniML ##
- Find a couple of references
- subset of ml, powerful enough to be interesting, but simple to be
  possible to write interpreters and compilers for in a class
- minicaml compiler by the japanese fellas
- other cool refs

Describe the syntax for it.

TODO: should i use the type checker to check. could work straight away
since the miniml isn't changed?


## Possible cool things to extend with?
- Olegs type checker stuff
-

Talk about Purescript being similar to haskell, but embracing the
semantics of Javascript. This could be done in a MiniML language that
compiles to js. PAttern matching, row type polymorpism.
